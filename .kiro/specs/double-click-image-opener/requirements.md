# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Double-Click Image Opener plugin enhances the Obsidian user experience by allowing users to quickly open images in their default system application through a simple double-click interaction. This plugin addresses the need for users to view images at full resolution or edit them using their preferred external image applications without having to navigate through file explorers or right-click menus.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want to double-click on any displayed image to open it in my default system application, so that I can view it at full resolution or edit it using my preferred image editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user double-clicks on an image displayed in Obsidian THEN the system SHALL open the image file in the default system application for that image type
2. WHEN the image file exists in the vault THEN the system SHALL locate and open the correct file path
3. WHEN the image file does not exist or cannot be accessed THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
4. WHEN multiple image formats are present (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, etc.) THEN the system SHALL handle all common image formats supported by Obsidian

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want the double-click functionality to work consistently across different view modes, so that I can access images regardless of how I'm viewing my notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing images in Reading mode THEN the double-click functionality SHALL work as expected
2. WHEN viewing images in Live Preview mode THEN the double-click functionality SHALL work as expected
3. WHEN viewing images in Source mode THEN the double-click functionality SHALL work as expected
4. WHEN images are embedded using different markdown syntax (![[image.png]] vs ![](image.png)) THEN the functionality SHALL work consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want the plugin to handle different image path formats correctly, so that it works with my existing vault structure and linking preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images use relative paths THEN the system SHALL resolve the correct absolute path for opening
2. WHEN images use absolute paths within the vault THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly
3. WHEN images are in subfolders THEN the system SHALL locate and open them properly
4. WHEN images have special characters or spaces in filenames THEN the system SHALL handle them without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want the plugin to provide feedback when operations succeed or fail, so that I understand what happened when I double-click an image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image successfully opens in the default application THEN the system SHALL provide subtle confirmation (optional notification)
2. WHEN an image fails to open due to file not found THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
3. WHEN an image fails to open due to system permissions THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the default application cannot handle the image format THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want the plugin to be lightweight and not interfere with normal Obsidian functionality, so that my note-taking experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is active THEN it SHALL not interfere with normal text selection or editing
2. WHEN the plugin is active THEN it SHALL not significantly impact Obsidian's performance
3. WHEN the plugin is disabled THEN all added event listeners SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. WHEN images are single-clicked THEN normal Obsidian behavior SHALL be preserved (no interference)
